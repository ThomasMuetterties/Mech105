# Description:
This algorithm uses Simpsons 1/3 Method to integrate experimental data. If the data has an even number of points it 
will complete the trapzoid rule in the last interval. The data needs to be entered as two seperate matricies, one 
for the x values and one for the y values (can either be a column or row matrix). 

## Inputs:
      
      x = indepent varaiable numbers in matrix form
      
      y = depedent varaiable numbers in matrix from
      
## Output:
   
       I = value for integral for supplied experimental data
