# Description:

            This algorithm uses Simpsons 1/3 Method to integrate experimental data. The data needs to
            be entered as two seperate matricies, one for the x values and one for the y values (can either be 
            column or row matricies). 

## Inputs:
      
      x = indepent varaiable numbers in matrix form
      
      y = depedent varaiable numbers in matrix from
      
## Output:
   
       I = value for integral for supplied experimental data
